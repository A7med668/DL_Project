# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

This project applies deep learning techniques to analyze Amazon product reviews and classify their sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient sentiment analysis model.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and cleaning text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for text representation.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A TensorFlow-based Sequential model for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy score.
- **Visualization**: Insights into data and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle:

- **Name**: Amazon Reviews Dataset  
- **Size**: ~300,000 reviews  
- **Link**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
